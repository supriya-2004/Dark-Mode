## ðŸ›  Technology Stack  

This project is built using the following technologies:  

### ðŸ“„ HTML (HyperText Markup Language)  
- Provides the **structure** of the webpage.  
- Used to create elements like the **toggle switch** and labels.  
- Ensures proper **semantics** and accessibility.

-----

### ðŸŽ¨ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)  
- Responsible for **styling and animations**.  
- Used for creating the **toggle switch design** and **smooth transitions**.  
- Includes `@keyframes` for **animation effects** when switching modes.

-----

### ðŸš€ JavaScript (JS)  
JavaScript is used to add **interactivity and functionality** to the project. The following JavaScript concepts are implemented:  

#### ðŸ“Œ **1. Event Listeners**  
- Used to detect changes in the toggle switch.  
- The `input` event listener triggers the theme change when the checkbox is toggled.  

#### ðŸŽ¯ **2. DOM Manipulation**  
The **Document Object Model (DOM)** allows JavaScript to interact with HTML elements dynamically.  

#### ðŸ›  Key Methods Used:  
- `document.querySelector()` â†’ Selects an element.  
- `element.style.property` â†’ Modifies CSS styles dynamically.  
- `addEventListener("event", function)` â†’ Attaches an event to an element.  

#### ðŸ’¾ **3. localStorage**  

##### ðŸ“Œ What is `localStorage`?  
`localStorage` is a **Web Storage API** that allows websites to store data in the browser **permanently** (until manually cleared). Unlike cookies, `localStorage` does not expire and is not sent with HTTP requests.  

##### ðŸ”¥ Features of `localStorage`  
- Stores data as **key-value pairs**.  
- Data persists **even after page refresh or browser restart**.  
- Can store **strings, numbers, arrays, and objects** (by converting to JSON).  
- Has a **5MB storage limit per origin**.
